\section{Implementation}

We implemented our approach in the TSTL \cite{NFM15} system.

Because TSTL supports differential testing \cite{tstlsttt}, horizontal
nondeterminism detection can technically be implemented simply by
declaring a system to be its own reference, using TSTL's notation for
differential testing.  However, such an approach requires some effort
on the part of the user to control which values are checked for
equivalence, and does not easily support injecting timing differences,
or using a new process, in checking the behavior.
